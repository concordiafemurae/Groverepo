The Grove Repo is a concise file archive that goes over the Grove project's timeline. It current consists of the KomplotGroupBand (2020), the Silent Moth (2020-2023), and the Infinite Grove (2024).

This archive consists of music files, videos, screenshots, conversation logs, and lore files. The majority of these files are the originals taken directly from their sources. Some are screenshots and media files from mass scrapers used during the initial archival project. As such, the dating on some files won't always align with the project year.

Information in this archive was gathered by dozens of community solvers over many thousands of hours of work. Their work is acknowledged and we are thankful for their contributions to the solving.
